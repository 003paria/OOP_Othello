# OOP_Othello

**This project is a fully functional implementation of the classic Othello game, designed in Java with a modular, object-oriented approach. This game is built for those interested in a complete, interactive experience of Othello, along with features like game saving and resuming.**

**This Othello game was developed using Java and follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The codebase is structured with modular classes, including Board, Game, Player, Position, PlayablePosition, and UnplayablePosition, to handle various aspects of the game logic. The modularity of the code allows for easy expansion and understanding of game mechanics.**
